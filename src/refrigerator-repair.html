            <p>
              In summer refrigerator repairs in Seattle are most in demand. Everything is quite understandable,
              because the intense heat forces cooling equipment to work almost all round the clock, which leads to the
              failure of many its components.

                <div class="item-nuances__text">
                  In the summer season, the demand for refrigerator repair increases several times, so finding a free

                  Motor-compressor breakdowns frequently happen during summer due to issues like improper refrigerator
                  installation or faulty sealing gum. Consequently, purchasing a new compressor for the refrigerator,
                  which can account for up to 20% of the cost of new refrigeration equipment, is often necessary.
